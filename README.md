# EP-Sem-4

I got an iPad just before 4th semester, and it was the best thing that happened to me. Here are my notes, all which I totally enjoyed while taking <3

Notes for QM and Analog are complete. 

However for DSP, my notes are class notes and might've missed a couple of classes here and there. And for Z transform, I don't have notes per-se. So, I have notes only for the Signals part of the course.
